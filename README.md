# Sample Code

A small sample of my work for Fujitsu, where I have designed and developed every aspect of an application to allow any Fujitsu employee and (to be rolled out soon) any HMRC employee to submit innovative ideas that will act as triggers for the Innovation Team's projects. These can be co-operative investigations, technology research, process improvements, proof-of-concepts, application improvements, new application development, etc.

The technology stack I chose is Angular 5 for client side, and Spring Boot 2 / Spring Framework 5 / MySQL for server side. Containerised using Docker, and deployed to Azure for QA and Production environments.

The samples effectively capture the slice through the application that implements user authentication.

## Client-side Sample

One sample each of an Angular 5 Component (and its supporting Service), a Directive, and a Pipe.  The Directive implements a 100% reliable auto-focus function that can be attached to a specific user input on a form. The Pipe implements a consistent Date formatter that can be used by any view.

## Server-side Sample

One sample each of a RestController, a Service, a Repository, an Entity (and its companion DTO).
